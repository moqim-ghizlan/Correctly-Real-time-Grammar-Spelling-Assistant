# Correctly 5.14.1 — Release notes

## Fixed: "unusable response" on longer translations and summaries (Gemini)

- Gemini counts its internal "thinking" in the same output limit as the
  answer. On a longer text (for example several lines translated into Syrian
  Arabic) the answer could be cut in the middle (`MAX_TOKENS`) and was then
  rightly refused as "The provider answered, but the response was not
  usable". Every Gemini request with a structured answer now gets 4,096
  tokens of thinking headroom, like an unreviewed OpenAI model already had.
  This is a bound, not a fixed cost: only the tokens actually used are
  billed. The key check ("Test") keeps its tiny budget.

## Changed: a larger, clearer Correctly window

- The window is larger (760 × 620 instead of 640 × 520; it still shrinks on
  small screens), with pill-shaped tabs, a taller text box, gradient primary
  buttons, error messages in a colored box, style choices and results as
  cards, and Apply / Copy / Cancel aligned right. Light and dark themes,
  reduced motion and high-contrast mode are kept. Style only: behaviour is
  unchanged.

## Important: never remove the extension to update it

- Removing Correctly in `chrome://extensions` deletes its data (keys,
  shortcuts, settings) and may delete its synced copy too (observed by the
  owner on 2026-10-20). To update: replace the folder's content with the new
  zip, then click **Reload** on the Correctly card. See `sharedProfil.md`.

- Tests: 41 files, 726 tests. Checked in the real-browser smoke test; the
  new window was checked visually (four tabs, dark and light). Not checked
  with a real key: the Gemini fix (owner test on the failing Syrian Arabic
  translation).

## 5.14.0 — Release notes

## Before you update: the extension ID changes once

5.14 gives Correctly a **fixed extension ID**
(`annnnjfiddfooccihpgebjnipppaejpo`), the same on every computer and
browser, so it can use the browser's synced storage. Because the ID
changes, **5.14 starts empty** the first time. Once per computer, before
installing 5.14:

1. Settings → **Text shortcuts → Export** (JSON). Import it in 5.14.
2. Note your API key names, routes and usage limits; enter them again in
   5.14 (keys are never exported, on purpose).
3. Optional: Statistics → export CSV/JSON as an archive. Statistics cannot
   be imported back: the history starts again at zero.

Remove the old version, then load 5.14. Later updates keep the same ID.

## New: optional sync between your computers

- New settings page **Sync**. **Off by default**; turn it on on each
  computer and choose what follows you: **Text shortcuts** (the list),
  **Settings** (interface language, rewrite styles and formality,
  translation preferences, keyboard and right-click triggers),
  **Correctly keyboard shortcuts** (the combinations), and **API keys and
  routes**.
- Through the browser's own sync (`chrome.storage.sync`, your Google
  account). **Correctly has no server** and sends nothing more itself.
- **API keys are encrypted on your computer** with a passphrase you choose
  (PBKDF2-SHA-256, 600,000 iterations → AES-GCM) before they leave it. On
  another computer, enter the same passphrase once to **unlock** them. A
  forgotten passphrase cannot be recovered: enter the keys again and choose
  a new one.
- **Text shortcuts are merged one by one**: shortcuts added on two
  computers are both kept, an edit or deletion on one reaches the other.
  When the same shortcut was changed on both, one version wins and the
  other computer offers **Restore**.
- First activation with two different sets of settings: you choose
  **Keep this computer's version** or **Use the synced version** (the other
  one is kept, restorable).
- **Never synced:** usage limits (each computer applies its own),
  statistics, permission to send text, the handle and access to all sites,
  "expansion on" and "Correctly shortcuts on" (they need site access on each
  computer).
- About **100 KB** in all (browser limit): a few hundred short shortcuts.
  Above that nothing is sent, nothing is cut, and the page says so. The page
  shows the space used, the status of each item, **Sync now** and **Delete
  synced data**.
- **Chrome:** supported. **Brave:** not guaranteed (Brave Sync works
  differently); not tested yet.

## Other changes

- The API key warning (AI providers) now says keys sync only if you turn it
  on, encrypted.
- `scripts/audit-dist.mjs` requires the fixed public key and refuses any
  private key in the package. The browser smoke test writes its evidence to
  `docs/v5.14/evidence/` and checks the Sync page (step Y01).
- Fixed an ESLint error in `scripts/i18n-options.mjs` (`console` global),
  present since 5.13.

## Test status

See [TEST_REPORT.md](TEST_REPORT.md): automated tests, lint, format, build
and the real-browser smoke test (Brave) pass. The two-computer manual
checklist ([MANUAL_TEST_CHECKLIST.md](MANUAL_TEST_CHECKLIST.md)) is **not
done yet**, including Brave sync and a live key on a second computer.
